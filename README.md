This project supports report for AE2130-II Low Speed Wind Tunnel Test course. Purpose of the code is to generate polar curves based on the sibulated and experimentally obtained data during Low Speed Wind Tunnel Test. To run, initiate main.py and follow input instructions in the console. You have a choice to generate Experimental (2D), Numerical (3D) or combined(both) data polars. The generated polars are saved to the polars folder in the repo.
